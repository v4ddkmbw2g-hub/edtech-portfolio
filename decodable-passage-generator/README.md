# Decodable Passage Generator — first example

This folder holds **one hand-built example sheet**, not the generator yet. The
point is to agree on what a finished sheet looks like before we build the
machine that makes 128 of them.

- `example-lesson-41.html` — open in a browser, click **Print / Save as PDF**
- `Mud Pig - Lesson 41 - EXAMPLE.pdf` — the printed result. Kept as the original example; the live sheets have since dropped the picture and gained a dictation line
- `check-pages.py` — measures each sheet against the page budget before printing,
  so we find what to trim instead of guessing (`python3 check-pages.py`)

## Why Lesson 41

Lesson 41 is "Short Vowels Review (all)" in the phonics tool's own curriculum.
By that point a reader has every single consonant, all five short vowels, the
`-s` ending, and six heart words (`the is a and to in`). Nothing else.

That means **no** silent *e*, **no** digraphs (`sh ch th ck`), **no** blends,
**no** vowel teams, **no** r-controlled vowels. "Mud Pig" obeys all of it:
55 words, 0 untaught sounds.

## About the picture — removed, and why

The reading page used to carry a small scene drawn in code. **It is gone as of
30 July 2026**, on the teacher's decision, and the reasoning is worth keeping:

> The child is meant to build the picture in their own mind from the words, and
> then **draw that understanding**. A picture at the top tells them what
> happens, so they read toward an answer they already hold, and the drawing page
> stops being a comprehension check and becomes copying.

The design was already admitting this. The grown-up sheet used to instruct the
parent to **"cover the picture while they read."** An instruction that exists
only to undo the harm of an element is an argument for removing the element.
Both are gone, and the space went to larger story type, larger heart-word cards
and the dictation line.

`props.py` still draws scenes and is left in place — it is used by nothing on
the reading page now. The **draw-it box keeps its own full page**; that was
never in question, and it is the comprehension check at this age.

## Deliberate layout choices, in case we want to change them

**Four sheets, and who owns each one is printed at the top.** Revised after
teacher review, July 2026 — the first draft mixed adult instructions onto the
child's page, which is just more words for a young reader to get confused by.

| Sheet | Owner | What's on it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Grown-up — keep this one | How to use it, what to say when it goes wrong, the dictation sentence to read aloud, what a good answer sounds like |
| 2 | The reader | Practice words and heart words, running **down** the page and large |
| 3 | The reader | **The story, whole.** Never split across pages |
| 4 | The reader | Draw what happened (top half), then write the sentence you hear (bottom half) |
| 5 | The reader | Three questions, explicitly optional |

**Every lesson prints the same five pages in the same order.** One shape every
time is one less thing for a child or a parent to work out.

Story type is set per lesson rather than per band — it grows until the story
fills its page, from **18px to 38px**. The binding limit is usually width, not
height: a story line must never wrap, because the line is the unit a child
points along. `wrap_check.py` confirms this in a real browser.

The drawing got its own sheet the moment taller writing lines stopped fitting
beside it. That is the rule working as intended: the page count gives, the
child's space does not.

**Space for young hands is non-negotiable.** A K–2 child is still learning to
hold the pencil, so small targets are a fine-motor problem before they are ever a
reading problem. When a sheet doesn't fit, cut adult text or add a page — never
the child's space.

- Writing lines **80px** tall, drawing box **7.8in** tall, ~34px between questions
- Story type **25 / 24 / 21 / 21px** by lesson band, heart-word boxes **42px**,
  handwriting rules **0.62in** per three-line group with a dotted midline
- Story lines must never wrap. The line is the unit a child points along, so
  type size is capped by the **widest line in the set**, not by page height
- Adult text may be 11–13px. A child's may not.
- Name lines are ~3in of ruled line, long enough for a whole name, tucked into
  the header row so they cost no vertical space

`check-pages.py` exists precisely so this rule survives contact with a full page:
it measures each sheet against the 940.8px letter budget and says which one
overflows, so the trimming comes out of headers rather than the drawing box.

**Warm-up words come before the story**, and they are the same words that appear
in it. First encounter should be in isolation, not mid-sentence.

**Say it the way school says it.** Where the grown-up sheet tells an adult what
to do when a child gets stuck, it offers both "sound it out" *and* "use your
sound spelling" — the phrases a teacher uses in class, so home and school match.

**The "sound check" is written for a parent, not an engineer.** It lives on the
grown-up sheet and says, in plain words, that every word can be sounded out and
what was deliberately kept out. The point is an adult who feels *empowered* to
follow the recipe — not an audit log.

## What the real generator still needs

1. **Writer agent** — drafts a story from the allowed sound list for lesson N.
2. **Grapheme auditor subagent** — goes word by word against the allowed set and
   returns every violation. It did not write the story, so it is not attached
   to it.
3. **Loop** — violations go back to the writer, re-audit, repeat until zero.
4. **Story-quality judge** — checks it is actually a story, not "Sam sat. Sam sat."
5. **Prop-box picker** — chooses props matching the story's nouns.

## Copyright rules (unchanged)

- Scope & sequence is a shared teaching method — fine to follow.
- Dolch (1936) is public domain — fine for sight words.
- Fry is **not** free — never use it.
- Never reproduce UFLI's wording, word lists, or page design. Original text only.

# The sound list and the checking loop

Added July 2026. This is the machinery the passages are built on.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `build_sound_list.py` | Generates the rulebook from the assessment tool's own curriculum. Every judgement call is a `note` you can argue with. |
| `sound-list.json` | The rulebook. 128 lessons; allowed graphemes, suffixes, prefixes, patterns, heart words, and forbidden spellings for each. Never hand-edit it. |
| `audit_passage.py` | The auditor. Checks a passage word by word. Did not write the story. |
| `check-pages.py` | Checks each sheet fits on paper. |

## The model

Cumulative **by lesson number**: a child at Lesson 41 has had 1–40. Confirmed by
the teacher — sheets go home in sequence, and a skill a child missed earlier is
a separate conversation between teacher and parent, not something a worksheet
should paper over.

## The loop

```
writer drafts -> audit_passage.py -> violations? -> back to writer -> re-audit
                                  -> zero -> story judge -> page check -> ship
```

`audit_passage.py` exits 1 on any violation. **Exit 1 means do not ship.**

## How the auditor got its rules

Every rule in it exists because an adversarial agent — one that did not write it
— found a word that slipped past the previous version. The first version called
**15,764 of 87,119 dictionary words (18%) readable at Lesson 41**, including
*picnic*, *basket*, *rabbit*, *little* and *vein*. After three rounds of the
loop that is **57 words (0.07%)** — a 277x reduction — and nearly all of the
survivors are genuinely readable (*digs*, *dogs*, *kids*, *mats*, *taps*,
*quit*, *quiz*).

Full write-up for a technical reader: **[ENGINEERING.md](ENGINEERING.md)**.

Round 1 added: medial consonant clusters (not just word edges), a
one-syllable-before-Lesson-66 gate, longest-match pattern scanning so *night*
isn't blocked for containing `gh`, y-as-a-vowel gating, untaught vowel pairs
(*lion*, *dial*), soft c/g with a hard-g exception list, stricter suffix
peeling, and empty input never counting as a pass.

**Round 2 caught the opposite failure**: round 1 had traded false negatives for
false *positives*, three of them bad enough to make whole lessons unwritable —
no word containing `q` passed at any lesson (so Lesson 32, the `qu` lesson,
rejected *quit* and *queen*); `milk`, `self`, `elf` and `film` were blocked for
45 lessons; and Lesson 85 could not use `ea`, the grapheme Lesson 85 teaches.
Also fixed: Lesson 66 was a cliff where the syllable gate switched off entirely
and *photograph* passed; *hundred* was being read as `hundr` + `ed`; Lesson 65
could not use *running*; *egg* and *odd* were rejected; *cold* and *kind* passed
at 53 as short-vowel words.

An unwritable lesson is a harder failure than a bad word slipping through — the
generator produces nothing and the teacher never learns why.

Words passing at each lesson, out of 120,958 dictionary words (3–9 letters):

| Lesson | 20 | 41 | 53 | 65 | 66 | 77 | 99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pass | 0.3% | 0.7% | 2.7% | 5.1% | 20.5% | 25.3% | 81.8% |

The jump at 66 is the two-syllable unlock and is legitimate. **The 81.8% at 99
is not yet tight enough** — from Lesson 99 the syllable limit is removed
entirely because affix lessons build long words. That is the next thing to
narrow.

`python3 audit_passage.py --selftest` runs all 87 cases as regression tests.

## What it still cannot do

Spelling alone cannot settle words like `lens` (is that `-s` a plural?), `snow`
(which `ow`?) or `head` (which `ea`?). These are listed in `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS`
rather than quietly passed. **The fix is a word bank** — an approved word list
per lesson with each word's grapheme breakdown. That is the next thing to build.

## Verified against UFLI, July 2026

An agent checked the whole list against UFLI Foundations' published Toolbox and
Scope & Sequence.

**The lesson order is correct.** Every lesson number teaches what UFLI says it
teaches, in the right sequence, and the count of 128 is right. The cumulative
model — a child at lesson N has had 1..N — matches everything UFLI publishes;
UFLI documents no prerequisites beyond plain sequence.

**17 entries had typos**, now corrected in `CURRICULUM_CORRECTIONS` in
`build_sound_list.py`, each citing what the tool says and what UFLI teaches. The
ones that changed what a child could read:

| Lesson | Tool said | UFLI teaches |
|---|---|---|
| 94 | `schwa` | `ea` /ĕ/ (head) and `a` /ŏ/ (want) — UFLI has no schwa lesson |
| 98 | silent letters `kn, wr, mb, m` | `kn, wr, mb` only — `mn` is taught nowhere in the 128 |
| 114 | `... high ...` | `aigh` — previously dropped, so never taught at all |
| 58 | `u` | `u_e`, and it carries a second sound /yū/ (cube) |
| 90 | `oo` /ŭ/ | `oo` /ū/ — the breve reversed the sound |
| 113 | `ear` /ɛr/ | the *hear* sound, not the *her* sound |
| 116 | `ough` /ə/ | `ough` /ō/ |
| 27 | `l /l/ Part 2, ai` | `l /l/ Part 2` — the stray letters are `-al`, not `ai` |

**Two things worth knowing:**

1. **The unit labels were not UFLI's.** UFLI has **14 units, all contiguous
   blocks** of consecutive lessons. The tool had 8 units that were not in numeric
   order — Lesson 98 filed under "VCe", lessons 84–88 placed before 77–83.
   Anything grouping by those units showed lessons out of teaching order. The
   real 14 are now in `UFLI_UNITS`.

2. **The wording matches a Learning A-Z correlation chart**, not UFLI's own
   document — every typo is a one- or two-character slip off that chart. Worth
   knowing which document to re-check against.

**The same typos are still in `phonics-assessment-tool/index.html`** and will be
re-imported unless fixed there. `CURRICULUM_CORRECTIONS` is what stands between
them and a child until then.
